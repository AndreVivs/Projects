### OBJECTIVE

The objective of creating this website is to implement and share my future and current projects, sharing a part of myself through this site. This could help other developers to get ideas, the general public to learn how the programation is applied in actuality and the recruiters in search of new talent that matches my skills :) also with businesses that want to obtain my services to grow up their brands and also publish content in my blog obtaining feedback and helping others share my knowledge.


### AUDIENCE

The crowd is all the developers that want to discover new projects, recruiters that want to know if my skills match a specific profile or people that are being with his business.

### TECHNOLOGIC SOLUTION

First of all, I determine the objective, and audience, design the logo, and the branding, and choose the style guide with the colour palette and the typography.

Then I searched different portfolios of developers to find inspiration to design the wireframes. I created each page, collected images, and redact the text understandably and focused on the audience.


HOME PAGE

The design for the home page was thought to easily access the information

I can say that the website that I took in mind at the beginning was created

#### LEARNING

Before completing this project I learned that it's so important to create first a structure like a wireframe, text content, images, and put together all the information to help us to do the necessary changes before starting the development of the interface. When we work with all the content first, the construction will be easier

I learned that is important to take in mind the acceptance criteria and create the wireframes and the content by the hand of the requirements because if we have a mistake, detecting and changing it will be faster.

All the organization, knowledge and the structure to follow a plan for a site step by step will help me in the future with new prjects, and take in mind the importance of HTML and CSS. Also motivated me to learn more about the design because I need to confess that was a good course to me.
