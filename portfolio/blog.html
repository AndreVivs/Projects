                    <h3>05. MINIMALISM: A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT IMPORTANT THINGS</h3>
                    <p>
                        Right now, minimalism is a huge trend in graphic design, from app interfaces to logos. But what is minimalism really all about, and how can it make your creative ideas better, rather than just make them look like everyone else?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Minimalism is a documentary about the important things where Matt D'Avella examines the roots of minimalism as a reaction to modern consumerism and media overload, and how it is being passed over to new movements such as simplified and ordered ways of living.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's important to note that this documentary, which is 1 hour and 18 minutes long, doesn't actually talk about the use of minimalism in graphic design. But it will help you better understand where the minimalist trend came from and why it has a cultural resonance in today's society.
