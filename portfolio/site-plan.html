      <h3>My story</h3>
      <p>
        Okay, find a comfortable place and a drink. For some people, it is easy to find their vocation for others
        not as much as was my case, so I think that if something calls you with all your strength you should always
        choose to do it regardless of the opinions of others in the end if you are wrong it will be an experience
        but if you will not know to search and find your passion and your happiness.

        The truth is that I wanted to study dance, languages and music but solving problems, the exact sciences
        and helping nature have always caught my attention, so after a talk with my mother I ended up applying
        to the university. She wanted me to study a less artistic career and said that if I didn't stay,
        she would let me do what I wanted but mothers always know something else so I entered industrial chemical engineering
        with a speciality in the environment but I couldn't leave the artistic part so I continued dancing and studying.
        While the semesters of the degree passed, I came across a subject where I learned Matlab and programming came into my life.
        Almost all the guys I took that subject with already had experience and I knew the class was in Spanish but
        I had no idea what they were talking about so even though I studied I failed :) but I tried it again and discovered
        that it was something that I liked like that I decided to change careers where I could combine my creative and logical side,
        after a programming Bootcamp I started my career at Brigham Young University - Idaho in applied technology,
        so here we are, learning, growing and enjoying the journey.

      <h3>Portfolio page</h3>
      <p>
        On this page, you Will find different projects that I have created during this time as a developer.
        I consider that having a website is a good place where I can publish my ideas, create new things,
        learn more about technology applying and share my technical skills. In each Project, I have obtained
        the experience to work with deadlines, and different types of personalities, talk with the users
        to implement the requirement of the projects, create wireframes, implement the logic with JS,
        design images, work with React, Node, git, GitHub, creating libraries on storybook, minimizing errors
        with typescript, and also tou can find projects created on react or with Java Scritp vanilla,
        also some designs are with libraries or usih HTML and CSS
